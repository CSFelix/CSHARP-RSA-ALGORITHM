# 🌟 RSA Algorithm 🌟

----
### `❓ What's it? ❓`

* Safety at Sea is a program that I developed for my University (I gotcha 10 with this program!!!). It uses RSA's Algorithm to encript and decript text messages, but, there are one special thing: I wrote the RSA proccess!!

* In bit words, I studied how RSA works and wrote a class that make this function. How the cipher class was wrote by me (😐😐) and use integer numbers instead byte datas, the program works just with small integers.

### `⚒️ Tools ⚒️`

* C# and Visual Studio;
* Windows as your Operational System.

----
### `⚙️ Run ⚙️`

> EXE

* Download the source code;
* Go to *Criptografia RSA\WindowsFormsApp1\bin\Debug* and opens the **Criptografia RSA.exe** file.

> Compile

* Download the source code;
* Import *Criptografia RSA* folder in your Visual Studio;
* Open the **Login.cs** file and compile it!

### `📝 Examples 📝`

* The software has three basic functions: information, cipher and CUMI!?; being each of them:

```
1) Information: you can access and read text and images information about a fictional situation (237 is the private key to decript the message, while 13 is the public key);
2) Cipher: you can encript and decript messages, besides to convert images to hexadecimal bytes (into 'Arquivos txt' folder there are 'Chaves.txt' file that contains some public and private key to use);
3) CUMI: yeahhhhhhhhhh, the first CUMI's version was developed in this project!!!!!!!!!
```

### `🎁 Bonus 🎁`

* Curiosite: about my **CSHARP-FERMAT-METHOD-RSA-ATTACK** repository, I mentioned that I developed it in order to test a program. So, this is the program!

* Into *DLL's* folder there are two dlls: Stsrem.Numerics and System.Speech, being:

```
- System.Numerics: used to proccess large integers numbers (BigInteger class);
- System.Speech: used to CUMI speak with us.
```
